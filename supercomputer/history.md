Brief history of supercomputing

ENIAC, which became operational in 1945, was the first electronic programmable general purpose computer. Originally located at the University of Pennsylvania it contributed to the US World War II effort. ENIAC relied on vacuum tubes and its performance was on the order of one thousand times greater than the preceding electro-mechanical computers.

ENIAC and its vacuum tubed successors were followed by transistorized systems in the later half of the 1950's. IBM's 7090 mainframe (first installation in 1959) was specifically designed for solving large-scale scientific and engineering problems.

The term supercomputing was first used in 1964 when Control Data Corporation introduced the CDC 6600 system designed by Seymour Cray, whose name went on to became synonymous with supercomputers. An improved version, called CDC 6700, was introduced in 1969. Cray subsequently left Control Data Corporation, founded a company of his own and in 1976 debuted the iconic Cray-1 supercomputer.
