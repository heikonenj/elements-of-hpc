Brief history of supercomputing

ENIAC, which became operational in 1945, was the first electronic programmable general purpose computer. Originally located at the University of Pennsylvania it contributed to the US World War II effort. ENIAC relied on vacuum tubes and its performance was on the order of one thousand times greater than the preceding electro-mechanical computers.

ENIAC and its vacuum tubed successors were followed by transistorized systems in later half of the 1950's.
